# stapl-Policy2ElasticsearchFilter

Implementation for my thesis 'Safe searches in big data' at KU Leuven

This project implements a reverse proxy that uses query rewriting to implement the access control policy defined in policyString, using attributes, on any Elasticsearch search query that arrives.
